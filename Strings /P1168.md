# Intuition
To determine how many times a given word can be repeated consecutively and still be a substring of a given sequence, start by progressively appending word to a string and checking if it remains a substring of sequence. Once it no longer is, compute how many times the word was appended.
# Approach
Initialize an empty string find.
Use a loop to keep appending word to find while find remains a substring of sequence.
When find is no longer a substring, compute the number of times word was appended.
The result is calculated as (find.length() - word.length()) / word.length() which gives the number of complete repetitions of word in sequence.

# Complexity
 Time complexity: O(nâ‹…m)

Where n is the length of the sequence and m is the length of word. This is because in each iteration, the contains check is performed which takes up to O(n), and the loop could run up to O(n/m) times if the sequence is long.

Space complexity: O(n)

The space complexity is determined by the length of the find string which, in the worst case, could grow up to O(n).


# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int maxRepeating(String sequence, String word) {
        String find="";
        while(sequence.contains(find)) find += word;
        return (find.length()-word.length())/word.length();
    }
}
```
