# Intuition
The problem asks us to find the k-th factor of a given number `n`. My initial thought is to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` and count the factors. Once the count reaches `k`, return that factor. If we complete the loop without finding `k` factors, then `n` doesn't have `k` factors, so we return `-1`.

# Approach
1. **Initialize a counter**: Start with a counter to keep track of how many factors we've found so far.
2. **Iterate through numbers** from 1 to `n`:
   - For each number `i`, check if it divides `n` evenly (`n % i == 0`).
   - If it does, increment the counter.
   - If the counter equals `k`, return the current number `i` since it is the k-th factor.
3. **Return -1** if we finish the loop and haven't found the k-th factor.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**:  
  The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ because we iterate from 1 to `n` in the worst case.
  
- **Space complexity**:  
  The space complexity is $$O(1)$$ since we are only using a few extra variables and no additional data structures.

# Code
```java
class P1492 {
    public int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        int count = 0; // Counter for factors
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // Iterate from 1 to n
            if (n % i == 0) { // Check if i is a factor of n
                count++; // Increment the factor count
                if (count == k) { // If the count equals k, return the factor
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1; // If no k-th factor is found, return -1
    }
}
