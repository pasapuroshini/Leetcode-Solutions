# Intuition
The problem requires finding the longest subsequence of words such that the corresponding elements in a binary `groups` array alternate. The idea is to iterate through the `groups` array and select words that have different group values than the previous word in the subsequence.

# Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start with an empty list `res` to store the result.
   - Use a variable `prev` to keep track of the previous group value, initialized to `-1` (which won't match any valid group value of 0 or 1).

2. **Iteration**:
   - Traverse the `groups` array.
   - For each element, check if the current group value differs from the previous one (`prev`).
   - If they differ, update `prev` to the current group value and add the corresponding word from the `words` array to `res`.

3. **Result**:
   - After completing the traversal, return the `res` list, which contains the longest alternating subsequence of words.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
  - The time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where `n` is the length of the `groups` array. This is because we are iterating through the array exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is $$O(n)$$, where `n` is the maximum possible size of the result list `res`.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> getLongestSubsequence(String[] words, int[] groups) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int prev = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.length; i++) {
            if (groups[i] != prev) {
                prev = groups[i];
                res.add(words[i]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
