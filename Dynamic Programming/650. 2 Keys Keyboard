/* This Java solution is designed to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to generate a string of length n consisting entirely of 'A' characters using only copy and paste operations. The logic behind the solution is based on breaking down the integer n into its prime factors. Each factor corresponds to a sequence of copy-paste operations needed to build up the string.

The code starts by checking if n is 1, in which case no operations are needed, and it returns 0. Otherwise, it initializes a variable steps to keep track of the total operations and a factor starting at 2. The solution then enters a loop that continues until n is reduced to 1. Inside this loop, the code checks if the current factor divides n. If it does, the factor is added to the total steps, and n is divided by this factor. This process repeats for all factors of n, incrementing the factor each time until all prime factors have been considered.

In essence, the solution works by summing up the prime factors of n, which directly corresponds to the minimum number of operations required to generate a string of n 'A's. The final result is the value of steps, which is returned by the function. The main method includes an example where n = 12, and it prints the minimum steps required for this input, demonstrating how the solution works.*/

/*Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
This is because the outer loop runs roughly sqrt(n) times in the worst case, and within each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs a constant number of times, depending on how many times the factor divides n.

Space Complexity
Space Complexity: O(1)
The space complexity is constant O(1) since the algorithm uses only a fixed amount of additional space, regardless of the size of n. The variables steps, factor, and n are the only ones used, and they occupy constant space.*/
