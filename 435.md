# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem asks us to minimize the number of overlapping intervals. A natural way to think about this is to prioritize intervals that end earlier because they leave more room for subsequent intervals. By carefully selecting non-overlapping intervals, we can minimize the number of removals required.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
### Sort Intervals:

- First, sort the intervals by their end times in ascending order. This ensures we always consider intervals that finish earlier.
- Sorting by end time is key because it helps us make a greedy choice: include the interval that ends earliest to leave space for others.
### Iterate Through the Intervals:

- Start by selecting the first interval as the initial non-overlapping interval.
- For each subsequent interval, check if its start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the previously included interval.
- If the interval does not overlap, include it in our selection and update the "previous interval."
- If it overlaps, skip it.
### Count Non-Overlapping Intervals:

- Keep a count of the non-overlapping intervals. Subtract this count from the total number of intervals to determine how many intervals need to be removed.


# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(nlogn)$$

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        int n = intervals.length;
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        int prev = 0;
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= intervals[prev][1]) {
                prev = i;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return n - count;
    }
} 
```
